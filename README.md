## Jqmap2

this is <strong>web mobile map project</strong> based on jQuery Mobile and <a href="http://openlayers.org/">OpenLayers</a> which can run in mobile browser.

if you have any question ,welcome to commemt.

there are also several demo from mapbox. 
cause I am going to replace ol2 with mapbox gl js or ol3.
**performance** are key element for mobile webapp, so light weighted
is more preferred.

- index2.html -> mapbox loading points from geojson
- 3 -> mapbox extrude 3d building from "height" props
- 4 -> mapbox load offline tiles.
- 5 -> mapbox animate positions like slideshow.

## Recently Update 2016/11/18:
Currently <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/">Mapbox GL JS</a> is applied to build A totally new flightgame, with pitch, bearing in viewport and webgl render.
